# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project-
This is a personal portfolio project built using Power BI to transform raw HR data into actionable insights. The report features interactive visuals designed for HR leaders and decision-makers to understand employee attrition, satisfaction levels, and trends in career progression.
## Business Introduction
Organisations are increasingly relying on data to retain talent, enhance work environments, and optimise workforce planning. HR analytics is a vital tool for analysing employee trends, predicting attrition, and aligning HR strategies with business goals.
## Business Problem
High employee turnover can negatively impact productivity, morale, and cost-efficiency. Many HR teams struggle with understanding:
â€¢	Where attrition is highest
â€¢	Which departments need intervention
â€¢	How employee satisfaction varies across roles and tenure levels
## Aim of this Project
To build a Power BI dashboard that answers critical HR questions by:
â€¢	Measuring attrition rate
â€¢	Identifying high-risk departments or job roles
â€¢	Analysing employee satisfaction and career tenure
â€¢	Helping HR take proactive actions
## Processes
1.	Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, renamed columns, and validated categorical fields.
2.	Data Modelling: Calculated key metrics like Total number of employees, Current Employee, Attrition rate/count and average age.
3.	Visualisation: Built interactive charts (doughnuts, bars, KPIs).
4.	Storytelling: Designed the dashboard layout to guide users through the data.
## Tools Used
â€¢	Power BI Desktop: for data modelling, DAX measures, and dashboard creation
â€¢	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): for custom calculations
â€¢	Power Query: for data transformation
â€¢	Microsoft Excel: as the data source.
## Insights
The dashboard uncovered the following:
â€¢	ðŸ”¹ Attrition is highest in certain departments like Sales and R&D.
â€¢	ðŸ”¹ Younger employees (25â€“34) and those with fewer years at the company are more likely to leave.
â€¢	ðŸ”¹ Job satisfaction and work-life balance scores vary significantly across departments.
â€¢	ðŸ”¹ A majority of employees from the Life Science Education field have more attrition records, as against Human Resources, with the fewest attrition records.
## Recommendations
. Focus retention efforts on departments with high attrition.
. Invest in employee satisfaction initiatives in departments with lower morale.
. Consider mentorship or career development paths for younger employees.
. Use this dashboard to monitor HR KPIs regularly and predict future attrition risks.
